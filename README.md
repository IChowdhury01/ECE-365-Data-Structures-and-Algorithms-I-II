# ECE-365: Data-Structures and Algorithms I&II
Projects for Data Structures and Algorithms classes.

## Project Descriptions

- BinaryHeap: Priority queue using a binary heap implementation. Each item inserted into the binary heap specifies a unique string id, an integer key, and an optional pointer.

- Dijkstra: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest-path problem. Program determines the shortest path in a specified graph from a specified starting vertex to each other vertex in the graph.

- DynamicProgramming: Solution to a 1998 ACM Programming problem, implemented using dynamic programming. Program accepts three strings and determines whether the third string is a valid merge of the other two. If so, the characters of from each substring are distinguished from each other.

- HashTable: Implementation of a hash table. The hash table is also used to spell check a document using a supplied dictionary.

- SimpleList: Program that manipulates stacks and queues. Reads in an input file with a list of commands, and uses it to create a stack or queue and push/pop items onto it.

- Sorting: Program that sorts the nodes of a linked list. Creates a list with four fields by reading an input file, then sorts the list according to one of the fields. Implemented using quicksort.

## Course Description
An introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms, with an emphasis on practical implementation issues and good programming methodology. Topics include lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables and sorting algorithms. Also an introduction to analysis of algorithms with big-O notation. Assignments include programming projects and problem sets.

A continuation of Data Structures & Algorithms I. Topics include graphs, graph-related algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. Also an introduction to some advanced topics such as Turing machines, computability and NP-complete systems. Assignments include programming projects and problem sets.
